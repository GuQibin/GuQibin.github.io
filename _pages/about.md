Here is a short bio. I am a Master's student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), majoring in Robotics.

My research interests include **Robotics**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Computer Vision**. Currently, I am working on Language-Guided Navigation via 3D Scene Graphs.

I have experience with Python and Java.
