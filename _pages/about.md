Hello! I am **Gu Qibin**, a Master's student in Robotics at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**. 

My career goal is to become a **Robotics Software Engineer**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between advanced algorithms and reliable software systems.

### 🚀 What I Do
I specialize in **Robot Learning**, **Computer Perception**, and **Backend Development**. My unique background combines:
* **Robotics & AI:** Deep Reinforcement Learning, Sim-to-Real transfer, and 6-DoF Grasping (PyTorch, Isaac Sim, ROS 2).
* **Software Engineering:** Building scalable backend systems and enterprise applications (Java, SpringBoot, Docker, Redis).

Previously, I graduated with a **First Class Degree (Top 5%)** from the University of Liverpool / XJTLU.

I am currently open to **Internship** and **Full-time** opportunities starting from 2026.
